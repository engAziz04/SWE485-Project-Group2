Project Structure

The project consists of four phases:

Phase 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Phase 2: Supervised Learning (Performance Prediction)

Phase 3: Unsupervised Clustering (Student Grouping)

Phase 4: AI-Based Recommendations

All phases are included as Jupyter Notebooks inside the repository.

How to Run

You can open and run any notebook directly using:

Jupyter Notebook

Google Colab

Just run the cells from top to bottom — no additional setup required.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the benefits of data-driven educational insights and how Machine Learning can support improving student performance through predictive analysis and smart recommendations.

All phases are complete and ready for evaluation.

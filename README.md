## Project Title
Student Performance Predictor

## Motivation
We aim to help students improve outcomes by predicting pass/fail or final grade from simple factors (study time, absences, prior failures) and turning these insights into actionable study tips.

## Dataset Source

Place one of the following files in `/Dataset/`:
- `student_performance.csv` (a unified/renamed file), or
- `student-mat.csv` and/or `student-por.csv` (original Kaggle files).

## Project Title and Motivation
**Project Title:** Student Performance Predictor  

**Motivation:**  
This project aims to predict students’ academic performance (pass/fail or final grade) based on factors such as study time, absences, and previous failures.  
By identifying patterns related to student success, the system can help students improve their study habits and overall performance.

## Dataset Source
The dataset is based on **“Student Alcohol Consumption”** from Kaggle, which contains academic and social information about students in Portugal.  
In this project, we use the educational attributes (study time, absences, grades, etc.) to analyze and predict student performance.

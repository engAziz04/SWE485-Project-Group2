# # Phase 4 — Integrating Generative AI
#
# This notebook implements Phase 4 requirements:
#
# 1. Integrate a Generative AI model (e.g., GPT or LLaMA) via an API.
# 2. Use at least two different prompt templates.
# 3. Demonstrate and compare the outputs of the templates.
# 4. Justify the choice of the final template to be used in the system.
#
# The notebook uses the StudentsPerformance dataset and the clustering
# results obtained in Phase 3.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 1. Imports and Dataset Loading

# %%
import pandas as pd

# Adjust the path if your Dataset folder structure is different
data_path = "../Dataset/StudentsPerformance.csv"

df = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Show first rows to verify columns
df.head()

# %% [markdown]
# ### 1.1. Cluster Labels (from Phase 3)
#
# We assume that Phase 3 added a `cluster_id` column to the dataset.
# - `cluster_id` is an integer (e.g., 0, 1, 2)
# - Each cluster is mapped to a performance label:
#   - 0 → High Performance
#   - 1 → Moderate Performance
#   - 2 → Low Performance
#
# If your mapping is different, you can adjust the dictionary below.

# %%
# Mapping from numeric cluster_id to descriptive label
cluster_labels = {
    0: "High Performance",
    1: "Moderate Performance",
    2: "Low Performance"
}

# Add a human-readable cluster label column
df["cluster_label"] = df["cluster_id"].map(cluster_labels)

# Check a few rows to make sure mapping is correct
df[["cluster_id", "cluster_label"]].head()

# %% [markdown]
# ### 1.2. Selecting Columns for Prompts
#
# We will use the student's performance in:
# - Math
# - Reading
# - Writing
#
# If your column names are slightly different (e.g., `math_score` instead of `math score`),
# update the variables below.

# %%
# Column names used in the dataset
MATH_COL = "math score"
READ_COL = "reading score"
WRITE_COL = "writing score"

df[[MATH_COL, READ_COL, WRITE_COL, "cluster_label"]].head()

# %% [markdown]
# ## 2. Generative AI API Setup
#
# In this section we configure the Generative AI API (e.g., OpenAI GPT).
# You can replace the library and the call if you are using LLaMA or another provider.

# %%
import openai

# TODO: Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key before running.
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# %% [markdown]
# ## 3. Prompt Templates
#
# We define **two different prompt templates**:
#
# - **Template A (General Study Recommendations)**  
#   Focuses on general advice based on the performance cluster.
#
# - **Template B (Subject-based Weekly Plan)**  
#   Produces a more detailed and structured weekly study plan using
#   the student's scores in math, reading, and writing.

# ### 6.1. Analysis (Text)
#
# Based on the generated outputs, we can typically observe:
#
# - **Template A (General Recommendations)**  
#   - Provides high-level, motivational advice.  
#   - Useful for giving general direction but may lack concrete steps.  
#
# - **Template B (Subject-based Weekly Plan)**  
#   - Uses the student's actual scores in Math, Reading, and Writing.  
#   - Produces more specific and actionable recommendations.  
#   - Better aligned with the goal of providing detailed advice or explanations
#     based on user (student) data.
#

# %% [markdown]
# ## 7. Final Template Selection (Justification)
#
# **Selected Template:** Template B — Subject-based Weekly Plan
#
# **Justification:**
# 1. Template B uses the student's actual performance scores (Math, Reading, Writing),
#    which makes the generated advice more personalized and relevant.
# 2. The output from Template B is more detailed and typically structured as a clear plan,
#    which is easier for students to follow.
# 3. Template B aligns better with the project goal of providing *detailed advice or
#    explanations based on user input* using Generative AI.
#
# Therefore, Template B is selected as the final prompt template to be integrated
# into the system.


# %% [markdown]
# ## 8. Conclusion
#
# In this notebook, we:
#
# - Integrated a Generative AI model (GPT) via an API.
# - Implemented two different prompt templates:
#   - Template A: General study recommendations.
#   - Template B: Subject-based weekly improvement plan.
# - Generated and compared outputs for both templates using real student data
#   and the performance clusters from Phase 3.
# - Analyzed the differences in quality, detail, and relevance.
# - Selected Template B as the final template, with a clear justification.
#
# This satisfies all the deliverables required for **Phase 4 — Integrating Generative AI**.
